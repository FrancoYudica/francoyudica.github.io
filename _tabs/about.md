Hi, I'm **Franco Yudica** — a Computer Science student in my final year, based in Argentina.  
Over the past few years, I've dedicated myself to learning **game development** and, more importantly, diving deep into the world of **computer graphics**.

What excites me most is **low-level programming** — I enjoy building things from scratch, whether it’s a custom rendering pipeline, a CPU raytracer, or a real-time visual effect powered by shaders. I love understanding how things work under the hood, and I’m constantly pushing myself to learn more about **rendering techniques**, **GPU programming**, and **engine internals**.

I'm currently seeking **remote opportunities** in graphics programming, rendering, tools, or engine development. While there aren't many graphics-focused roles in Argentina, I'm open to collaborating internationally and excited to contribute to ambitious, technically demanding projects.

If you're looking for someone passionate, resourceful, and technically solid — especially when it comes to real-time graphics — I'd love to connect.

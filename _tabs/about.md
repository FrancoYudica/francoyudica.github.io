Hi, I’m Franco Yudica, a Computer Science student in my final year, based in Argentina.

Over the past few years I have dedicated myself to learning game development and building interactive experiences, while also diving deep into the world of computer graphics. What excites me most is low-level programming. I love creating things from scratch, whether it’s a custom rendering pipeline, a tool that streamlines development, or a unique gameplay mechanic brought to life through shaders.

I enjoy exploring how systems work under the hood and pushing myself to learn more about rendering techniques, GPU programming, and engine design. Beyond graphics, I am equally motivated by the creative side of making games and tools that engage and inspire players.

I am currently seeking remote opportunities in graphics, tools, engine development, or game programming. While there are not many specialized roles in Argentina, I am open to collaborating internationally and eager to contribute to ambitious, technically demanding projects.

If you are looking for someone passionate, resourceful, and technically solid, with a love for both real-time graphics and interactive design, I would love to connect.

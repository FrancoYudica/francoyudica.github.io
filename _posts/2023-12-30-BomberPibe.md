BomberPibe was my very first project in Godot. I created it in my university's programming club, working alongside another programmer, an artist, and a music producer. This was the first time I collaborated with a team, and it was an amazing experience, learning how to coordinate, share ideas, and bring a vision to life together. While attending classes, we developed this game as a side project, experimenting with the engine and having a lot of fun along the way.

BomberPibe also marked a turning point in my development journey: it was the first time I truly used a game engine instead of building everything from scratch, giving me the foundation to approach future projects with more structure, creativity, and teamwork.

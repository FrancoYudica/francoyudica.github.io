## Shapeify ‚Äì My AI Final Project Turned Passion Project

For my final AI class project, I wanted to go beyond the standard requirements and create something that truly excited me ‚Äî especially something related to computer graphics.

I developed **Shapeify**, an application that takes a set of input images and reconstructs any target image using those images. It leverages **local search algorithms**, such as **hill climbing** and **genetic algorithms**, to optimize the reconstruction.

After passing the AI final exam, I felt so passionate about the project that I spent the entire summer continuing to develop it. It became the **biggest project I've worked on so far**, and it taught me an incredible amount ‚Äî particularly in the areas of computer graphics and artificial intelligence.

## üß† Skills I Gained

Here are some of the many skills and technologies I learned while building Shapeify:

### üß± Graphics & Rendering
- Explored **Godot's low-level rendering pipeline**
- Built a **custom batched sprite renderer**
- Developed a variety of **compute shaders**, including:
  - **Gaussian Blur**
  - **Sobel Operator** and **Difference of Gaussians** for edge detection
  - **Parallel reductions** for summing image pixels
  - **Average color samplers** (multiple strategies)
  - **Error metrics** between images using **Delta-E** and **CIELAB color space** for perceptual accuracy

### ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence
- Integrated **local search algorithms** (hill climbing, genetic algorithms) into an image-based optimization problem
- Tuned AI behaviors for artistic and perceptual objectives

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool & UI Development
- Built a **large, customizable UI system** in Godot
- Developed the app into a full **standalone desktop tool**
- Added support for animations and **post-processing effects**, including:
  - Hue, Value, and Saturation Shifts
  - RGB Shift
  - CIELAB Shift

### üìù Professional & Collaboration Skills
- Wrote a [**whitepaper**](https://github.com/FrancoYudica/Shapeify/blob/v1.0.0/whitepaper_esp.md) detailing the algorithms and techniques used
- Published and maintained the app on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/FrancoYudica/Shapeify/)
- Tested across platforms (Windows & Linux)
- Engaged with the community and collaborated through GitHub

Pixel Adventure was one of my very first projects, and the first game I truly committed to finishing. It’s a 2D platformer built entirely in pure Python with Pygame, no engines, no shortcuts, just code.

What makes this project special to me is not that the code is perfect (it isn’t), but that I was able to bring a complete game to life from scratch in just two months, without any formal computer science or game development background at the time. I taught myself everything along the way, from the fundamentals of tilemap rendering and collision detection to designing levels with Tiled, building a responsive camera system, implementing animations, UI, a settings menu, player progression persistence, level transitions, and even a respawn system.

Looking back nearly five years later, there are many things I would do differently with the experience I’ve gained, but that’s exactly why this project means so much to me. It represents the start of my journey as a game developer, proof that I could learn, create, and finish something ambitious entirely on my own.

Pixel Adventure may be an old project now, but for me it will always be the foundation of my passion for game development, and I’m still incredibly proud of it.

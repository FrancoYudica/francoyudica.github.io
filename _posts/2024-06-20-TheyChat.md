## They Chat
TheyChat is a client-server chat application developed solely by me. The application allows multiple clients to connect to a server,exchange messages and files. The project is built using **CMake** and is designed to run on **POSIX systems**, utilizing **pthreads** for multithreading and **ncurses** for a simple client UI. Communication between the client and server is encrypted using **OpenSSL**.

## Features
- **Multithreaded Server**: Handles multiple clients concurrently using pthreads.
- **Client UI**: Simple text-based interface built with ncurses.
- **Encrypted Communication**: Ensures secure message transfer using SSL.
- **File transferring**: Clients can upload and download files.
- **Commands**: Clients can send messages and execute commands.
- **Cross-platform**: Designed to run on POSIX-compliant systems.
- **CMake Build System**: Easy to build and manage the project.
- **MIT Licensed**: Open-source and freely available for modification and distribution.

## What I Learned
- Functional programming and its benefits in certain scenarios
- Low-level programming and the importance of memory management
- Building multithreaded applications using the thread pool pattern
- Understanding and implementing client-server architecture
- Low-level network programming, including handling custom message types
- Implementing remote procedure calls (RPC)
- Designing and managing asynchronous tasks
- Securing communication with **TLS encryption**
- Rendering polished UI in the console using the **ncurses** library
- Implementing custom file transfer protocols
- Understanding the importance of robust error handling

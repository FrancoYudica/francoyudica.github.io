This endless vertical scroller throws you into a fast-paced action game where every moment is a test of your reflexes and precision. Armed with your trusty grappling hook, you'll swing through tight spots, avoid deadly obstacles, and outrun a rising death wall that never stops. It’s a race against time where momentum is everything—the faster you play, the faster you move.

Perfect for fans of arcade games, grappling mechanics, timed survival challenges, and skill-based platformers. How long can you survive the climb.

I hope you like it!

## Path Forger
Joined the [Godot Wild Jam #68!](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-68)

The theme for this jam was Forge. I really wanted to make a mobile game—specifically, an endless, randomly generated one. I also aimed to create something simple but polished, with a strong focus on graphics and gameplay, given the short timeframe.

After 9 days of juggling college, everyday life, and game dev, I submitted Path Forger!

I’m honestly surprised by the amazing reception the game received. It got tons of wonderful comments and even placed [**#1 on fun!**](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-68/results/fun).

It also did really well in several other categories:

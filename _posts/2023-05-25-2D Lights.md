[2D Lights](https://github.com/FrancoYudica/2D-Lights) It's an offline 2D Light renderer. Uses a mix of Ray Marching and Path tracing techniques to render.

The main goal of this project was to learn about PBR (Physically Based Rendering) in a simple environment, where no GPU and 3D graphics is required.

In this project, I learned about:
- Offline rendering
- 2D Signed distance fields
- Materials which determine how an object interacts with light.
  - Emission and intensity
  - Reflectance: Schlick's approximation of Fresnel equations
  - Refraction: Snell's law and total internal reflection
  - Absorption: Beer Lambert
- Gaussian antialiasing
- Gamma correction 2.2
